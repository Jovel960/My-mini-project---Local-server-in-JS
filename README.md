Hello !

Welcome to my mini project based on JS

I created two local servers where each server have another content, after that i created some unit testing with jest 
to verify that the server is working properly.

Please before you running this project make sure you have installed on your computer :

VS Code
nodeJS
Jest : 'https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started'
Express : run this command in your TERMINAL 'npm i --save-dev nodemon

To run the server enter this command : npm runDevstart

To perform the jest testing run this command : npm test

Enjoy !
